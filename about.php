                <p>My interest and love for Web and Graphic design began way back in grade 9, when I took a tech class and began hashing out websites using good 'ol DreamWeaver's <b>design</b> view. <i>(I now shudder)</i> </p>
                <p>I now currently attend Carleton University for the Bachelor of Information Technology, in the stream of Interactive Multimedia and Design. It is here where my love for Web Development and Illustration came to fruition. </p>
                <p>I have worked for the Canadian Medical Protective Association where I was a Web Developer and QA analyst, and Kivuto Solutions where I was a front-end developer. I enjoy being a part of internal teams, such as the Eats and Entertainment Committee at Kivuto Solutions, where we would plan montly company events. </p>

                <h3><img src="img/icons/heart.png" align="middle">Interests</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p>I spend most of my spare time reading web dev blogs such as Smashing Magazine, Abduzeedo, Net tuts, and David Walsh blog, and hacking around on projects I find cool! I absolutely have a soft spot for flat design, and I sometimes mess around in illustrator with some flat designs and complementary colour schemes.</p>
                <p>When I'm not nerding out on the computer, you can find me tinkering with my R/C helicopters, or playing Starcraft II and Age of Mythology with my friends. I also attend Web Related meetups in Ottawa, such as Ottawa Ruby, AngularJS and Ottawa JavaScript!</p>
